This is partly due to the fact that the presented retrieval set-up is also capable of doing multi-band retrievals, i.e. retrieve XCO2 using more than one absorption band. While this workbook only uses one spectral window at a time, it would be relatively straightforward do extend the code to perform a multi-band retrieval."

Each spectral window is identified by a number which represents the order in which the window (generally?) appears in the PROFFAST \"invers input file\". Look at the `inp_fast` folder inside PROFFAST (or PROFFASTpylot) for a file named `invers24*.inp`, which may have those windows listed. Each entry also includes information whether the spectral data is found in a \"SN\" or \"SM\" spectral file, which denotes whether the meaningful data was recorded with the first channel (SN) or the second channel (SM). Finally, each entry requires spectroscopy data: there we define which gases we want to include in the retrieval, and which spectroscopy file and VMR unit we want to use.\n",
